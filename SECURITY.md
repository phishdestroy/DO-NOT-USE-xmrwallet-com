## I lost funds on xmrwallet.com — what do I do?

### Step 1 — Secure your evidence immediately

Before doing anything else, collect and save:

- [ ] Your **wallet address** (the one you used on xmrwallet.com)
- [ ] Your **seed phrase** (if you have it — store offline, never share)
- [ ] **Transaction IDs (TxID)** of deposits you made
- [ ] **TX Key** if you have it (proves you sent a specific transaction)
- [ ] **Screenshots** of your wallet balance before and after
- [ ] **Browser history / timestamps** showing when you used the site
- [ ] Any **email correspondence** with xmrwallet.com support
- [ ] Your **IP address logs** if available (check your router or VPN)

The more evidence you have, the stronger any legal action becomes.

---

### Step 2 — Verify the loss independently

Check your wallet address on a public Monero explorer to confirm transaction history:

- https://xmrchain.net
- https://localmonero.co/blocks
- https://monero.observer

Enter your wallet address or TxID. This gives you an independent record
that cannot be altered by xmrwallet.com.
