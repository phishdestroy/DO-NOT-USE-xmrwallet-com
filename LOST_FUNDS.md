# If You Lost Funds — Read This First

**You are not alone. This is documented. There are steps you can take.**

## Immediate checklist

Copy this and fill it out. Keep it offline (text file, paper — not in a browser).

```
DATE OF LOSS:
WALLET ADDRESS USED:
APPROXIMATE AMOUNT LOST (XMR):
APPROXIMATE AMOUNT LOST (USD at time):
TRANSACTION ID(s) (TxID):
TX KEY (if you have it):
DATE YOU CREATED THE WALLET ON XMRWALLET.COM:
DID YOU CREATE THE WALLET ON THE SITE OR IMPORT EXISTING: 
YOUR COUNTRY:
DID YOU CONTACT XMRWALLET SUPPORT: YES / NO
THEIR RESPONSE (if any):
```

Save this. You will need it for every report you file.

## Verify your loss on a public explorer

Go to https://xmrchain.net and search your wallet address or TxID.

This gives you an independent, unalterable record of:
- When funds arrived at your wallet
- When they left
- Where they went (output addresses, if visible)

Screenshot everything. Save the URLs.

## Warning: recovery scams

After losing crypto, victims are frequently targeted by "recovery services."

They will claim they can trace and recover your Monero.
They will ask for an upfront fee.
They will disappear with that fee too.

**There is no legitimate service that can reverse Monero transactions.**
Anyone claiming otherwise is lying to you.

If someone contacts you offering recovery after you post about your loss —
report them here: https://github.com/XMRWallet/Website/issues
